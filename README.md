**Opinion Thus Far**

With how far I've gotten in the game, I personally think it's above and beyond from BOTW from 2016. XXXxxXXXxxXXxxxXXxxxxxXXXxxxXXXxxxxXXxXxxxXX

**Plan for Future**
1. Clear the entire Depths
2.  Explore all the Sky
3.  Unlock all shrines or most as possible

  ## Progress
  > Between me and my best friend, we are competing to see who'll finish the game or a large section of it first.
- Open the entire upper land and sky map
- Obtain the Hylian Shield
- Clear one section of the Main Story

`Friend mentioned is Isabel`
